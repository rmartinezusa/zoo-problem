            <p>Alligators Facts: Alligators can go through a process called brumation, similar to hibernation. During colder months, they slow down their metabolism and become less active, often staying submerged in water with just their nostrils above the surface to breathe. This allows them to survive harsh winter conditions without eating for months. To learn more click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
